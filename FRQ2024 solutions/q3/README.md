The isWordChain method checks whether each word in the list (except the first word) is part of the previous word in the list.
This method compares each word in the list to its preceding word. This method will return true if each word (starting with the second word) contains the previous word as part of itself. If any word does not meet this condition, it will return false.
This method returns true if every word in the list (except the first word) contains the previous word as a substring. Otherwise return false.
